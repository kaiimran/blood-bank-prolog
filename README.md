# blood-bank-management-system-prolog
Prolog is a logic programming language associated with artificial intelligence and computational linguistics.

Blood Bank Management System (BBMS) is a project that is designed to:
1. Check the compatibility of the blood according to the donor's blood type and patient's blood type.
2. Test the qualification of the donors either they are qualified to donate by using a qualification rule that will compare their facts (diseases) with another facts (what diseases are considered to be unqualified for blood donation).
3. Count how many bags are left for a particular blood type and whether they are in low stock.

This is my project for CSC305 - PROGRAMMING PARADIGMS course in Diploma in Computer Science
